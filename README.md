# TicTacToe

## Quickstart
1) `git clone https://github.com/Chillout93/TicTacToe_Template.git`
2) `npm install`
3) Navgiate to public folder in a file directory
4) Open `index.html` in a browser
4) Run `npm test` to run all your tests, it will pick up any file with a .test extension

## Rules
Your challenge is to implement a simple 3x3 board of TicTacToe (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) with the above skeleton project in Typescript and React. The task will start on Friday, and we'll review all our solutions on Monday morning. 

The person who is voted to have the best implementation wins the challenge, what makes the best implementation will be up to all of us to decide, but here are some official metrics to start with. I will personally be interested in a solution which is simple, has not been overengineered, but is not too rigid against future improvements.

- Functionality 
	- Suitability
	- Accuracy
- Reliability
	- Maturity
	- Fault Tolerance
	- Recoverability
- Usability
	- Understandability
	- Learnability
	- Operability
	- Attractiveness	
- Efficiency
	- Time Behaviour
	- Resource Utilization
- Maintainability
	- Analyzability
	- Changeability
	- Stability
	- Testability

## Bonus Round
To aid the discussion, please each bring with you one idea about a feature we could add to TicTacToe, and we'll discuss how easy that feature would be to implement in each of our solutions.
